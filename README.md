> Grunt automation made easy for large projects

## Why Croak?

<img align="right" height="280" src="http://oi44.tinypic.com/f3azc7.jpg" style="float: right" />

[Grunt][1] is an awesome utility well community adopted to automate common tasks and simplify your life in Node.js related projects

Croak is simple, but featured wrapper for Grunt, that aims to help you to manage and orquestate 
Grunt tasks configuration across large and distributed projects, 
always thinking about saving time and reducing changes impact

Croak borns from the need to create an specific solution to abstract all the automation 
configuration stuff, allowing you to delegate responsabilities in a proper way and sense
in your projects

## Installation

It is recommended to install it as global packages (assuming it will be via `$PATH` accesible)

```shell
$ npm install -g croak
```

### Getting started

After you install it, create the global config file for your projects
```
$ croak config -g create
```

Create a well-formed ini file called `.croakrc` in your `$HOME` or `%USERPROFILE%` directory

### How it works

In a few words, Croak allows you to have a multiple `Gruntfile.js` in a global locations, and running them 
using a simple alias

Croak allows your to extend or override Grunt configuration in distributed projects, this feature is useful
when you think the developers are not evil guys, delegating some responsability and liberty to them

### Example scenario

A representative scenario will be, for example, if your project have a relevant 
number of repositories. Each repository need its automation configuration 
for development, testing or building stuff.
The Node-related software design is local focused, 
Usually, this configuration tends to be complex when your project uses different technologies

when you are in large project scenarios, and you have a lot of repositories

### I do really need Croak?

Abstraction is not always the best choice and some people can hate it.
Basically, an abstraction, in software development, tries to reduce notably complexity 
hiding underlying details.

With Croak you can provide an ideal level of abstraction to developers and at the same time,
you can offer the possibility to pass part of the abstraction, providing more responsability to 
the developer

#### Stage

Croak is a initial version ready to use, however is under active (re-)designing process 
and important changes can be applied in a few future

#### Grunt support

Croak supports Grunt 0.4.x

## Features

- Centralize your project build tasks configuration
- Independent, synchronized and shared build task configuration across different repositories
- Support for configuration overriding in global configuration
- Support same Grunt API and CLI
- Keep clean your repository without Grunt node packages (in front end projects cases)

### Design principles

- If the abstraction provides missing features, and them are well done, its welcome
- Keep Grunt API and similar use

## Configuration file

Croak supports two configuration files: 

- Global configuration localted in `$HOME` or `%USERPROFILE%`
- Local configuration located in your project root directory

The Croak configuration file must called `.croakrc`

### Available configuration options

#### Global 

```
[super-project]
gruntfile = /home/me/projects/super-project/grunt-project
allow_register_tasks = true
```

##### Supported options per project

```ini
[my-project]
override = true
register_tasks = true
;package = build-package
;; grunt-specific
gruntfile = ${HOME}/projects/my-project/Gruntfile.coffee
base = ${HOME}/projects/my-project/data/
no_color = false
no_write = false
debug = false
verbose = false
force = false
stack = false
tasks = ../custom-tasks/
npm = mytask
```

- allow_register_tasks `boolean` Enable/disable register new Grunt tasks from local config

#### Local

- `project` Croak project alias
 
## Croakfile

Like Grunt, Croak has its own specific configuration file

```coffee
module.exports = (croak) ->

  registerTasks: (croak, grunt) ->
    croak.registerTask 'js-minification', ['clean', 'uglify'] if croak.taskSupported 'uglify'

  config: (croak, grunt) ->
    croak.set 'uglify', {
      options: 
        sourceMaps: true

      minify: 
        files: 
          src: ['**/*.js']
          dest: '<% croak.cwd %>/test'
    }

```

## Croak CLI
 
`TODO`

## Croak API

`TODO`

## Use Croak from existent Gruntfile.js

If you already have `Gruntfile.js` in each local repository of your project and you do not want to switch
radically to Croak, you can use the `grunt-croak` task to make a less impact with the same result

```
$ npm install grunt-croak --save-dev
```
For more information, see the [grunt-croak][2] documentation

### Development

Only Node.js is reguired for development

1. Clone/fork this repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:adesisnetlife/croak.git && cd croak
```

2. Install package dependencies
```
$ npm install 
```

3. Run tests
```
$ npm test
```

## Contributing

Croak is completely written in LiveScript language.
Take a look to the language [documentation][4] if you are new with it.
Please, follow the LiveScript language conventions and [coding style][4]

You must add new test cases for any feature or refactor you do, 
also take in mind follow the same design/code patterns already existing
